## ‚ùì What is Quantum Machine Learning?

Quantum Machine Learning is an interdisciplinary field that aims to harness the power of quantum computing to enhance machine learning algorithms. By utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics, QML algorithms offer the potential for exponential speedup in solving certain computational problems compared to classical machine learning techniques. QML explores concepts such as quantum data representation, quantum variational circuits, and quantum algorithms tailored for specific machine learning tasks.

## üåü Basic Concepts of QML:

- **Quantum Data Representation:** Quantum data representation involves encoding classical data into quantum states, utilizing superposition and entanglement properties of quantum systems.
- **Quantum Variational Circuits:** Variational circuits consist of adjustable parameters that can be optimized to solve machine learning tasks. These circuits are the building blocks of many QML algorithms.
- **Quantum Algorithms:** QML algorithms, such as quantum support vector machines (QSVM), quantum neural networks (QNN), and quantum clustering algorithms, leverage quantum properties to improve computational efficiency for specific machine learning tasks.

## üìù Code Description:

The code in this repository, created by [Kawsar Ahmad](https://github.com/KawsarAhmad43), demonstrates a simple quantum circuit that encodes classical data '0' into a quantum state using the Qiskit library. The purpose of the code is to showcase the basic process of quantum data representation and simulation in QML. It initializes a quantum circuit, encodes classical data, executes the circuit on a simulator backend, and retrieves the resulting statevector.

## üíª Code Usage:

To run the code, you will need to set up a Python environment with Qiskit installed. Follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation of the Qiskit library. Once the environment is set up, execute the code to observe the quantum circuit's creation, classical data encoding, circuit execution, and statevector retrieval.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to explore more advanced concepts in Quantum Machine Learning using Qiskit.
